1. Fake News Detection Using NLP

Description
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a robust and efficient pipeline that can classify news articles as "Fake" or "Real" based on their content.

The solution leverages preprocessed datasets and state-of-the-art machine learning models, combined with linguistic analysis, to ensure high accuracy in detection.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words.
Feature Extraction: Uses TF-IDF and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Model Training: Employs machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and advanced transformers like BERT.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.
