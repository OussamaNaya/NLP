## Description

<p>
  This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
  The goal is to build a robust and efficient pipeline that can classify news articles as <strong>"Fake"</strong> or <strong>"Real"</strong> based on their content.
</p>

The solution leverages preprocessed datasets and state-of-the-art machine learning models, combined with linguistic analysis, to ensure high accuracy in detection.

## Features
<ul>
  <li><b>Text Preprocessing:</b> Includes tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words.</li>
  <li><b>Feature Extraction:</b> Uses TF-IDF and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).</li>
  <li><b>Model Training:</b> Employs machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and advanced transformers like BERT.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.</li>
</ul>
