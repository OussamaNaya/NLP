<p>
  This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
  The goal is to build a robust and efficient pipeline that can classify news articles as <strong>"Fake"</strong> or <strong>"Real"</strong> based on their content.
</p>

The solution leverages preprocessed datasets and state-of-the-art machine learning models, combined with linguistic analysis, to ensure high accuracy in detection.

<ul>
  <li><b>Text Preprocessing:</b> Includes tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words.</li>
  <li><b>Feature Extraction:</b> Uses TF-IDF and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).</li>
  <li><b>Model Training:</b> Employs machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and advanced transformers like BERT.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluation Metrics:</b> Includes precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.</li>
</ul>

This project aims to build a machine learning model to analyze movie reviews and predict the sentiment behind them. The model uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages CountVectorizer for text representation and a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment classification.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Processes text reviews and removes stopwords using CountVectorizer.</li>
  <li>Trains a Naive Bayes model to classify sentiments effectively.</li>
  <li>Supports analyzing individual reviews or batches of reviews.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>CountVectorizer</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preview</h2>
